# Los Angeles Mountains - A Dynamic HTML/CSS/Javascript Landing Page

## Code Summary

This landing page is a Skill Testing project given by Coalition Technologies to assess how well a candidate can convert a PSD file to HTML. I was fortunate enough to be able to do this project as part of an interview process for a job role at that company.

• Built the entire landing page from scratch as per the layout given in an Adobe PSD file as part to understand the design requirements.

• Optimized the code by making it more dynamic by writing Javascript logic and JSON files to dynamically render data on the page.

• Utilized Bootstrap to create a carousel to show demo images for a Mountain on the page.

• Created a tabbed section to display schedules for different Mountains.

• Created a responsive layout across all devices.

• Deployed site to Netlify.

## Code Explanation

As per the design requirements, the page is divided into 3 sections.

Section 1 contains a beautiful Los Angeles Mountains background that serves as a beautiful welcome sight to see for people visiting the page. On top of it, it has a beautiful top-bar that also serves as a navbar to jump between sections.

As you will scroll down, you will notice that there is a Navbar that moves to the top and sticks as we keep scrolling, it has the Los Angeles Mountains logo and hyperlinks to the sections of the site. This navbar was made functional with the help of Javascript.

Section 2 contains a beautiful background for the History section with a styled heading and subheading and some Lorem Ipsum description. It also has a carousel made using Bootstrap, dynamically rendered by using a mock api created using a JSON file and using Javascript to display the data dynamically to show that even if new images are updated for a section using an API, and if an actual API was used in place of it, it would have dynamically added and updated images from it.

Section 3 contains a heading and subheading, and some Lorem Ipsum description. Then there is a tabbed sub-section that shows the recent schedule for an upcoming team event for a specific mountain if you click any tab. The data is dynamically rendered with the help of a mock API created with a JSON file containing schedules for the Mountain sites and uses logic written in Javascript to render data depending on the tab clicked, displaying the schedule for a team event for a mountain. I chose to make this dynamic too rather than static to minimize code and also to show that if it was an actual Schedule displaying site that utilized API to display schedules, it would have dynamically added, deleted and updated a given schedule depending on any change made to it at the backend or any schedule displaying API used in place of it that contains schedules for Mountain team events. By default Mountain 1 is selected and it's schedule is displayed but clicking across tabs will display the schedule related to those Mountains.
